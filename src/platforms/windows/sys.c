/* NOTES:
 *   - All calls to WSAGetLastError are thread-safe. Winsock keeps separate error codes pre-thread.
 *   - Ideally we would like to handle our socket identifiers without the need for some complex mapping to the 
 *     underlying socket descriptor used by the platform. Under most Unix systems, sockets are part of the standard C 
 *     library, no additional dependencies are required and file descriptors (integers) are used as identifiers. Under 
 *     Windows we have to use WinSock to which socket descriptors are an opaque type (usually normal NT kernel object 
 *     handles). This means that instead of type int, sockets need to be of type SOCKET and the classic comparison of 
 *     < 0 to detect error conditions or a bad descriptor is no longer valid - one has to use the INVALID_SOCKET
 *     constant instead. We worked around all this by using an opaque pointer to represent the socket which also serves
 *     to keep a to internal state. It's worth noting though that while winsock sockets are supposed to be 
 *     interchangeable with instances of HANDLE in many windows APIs, Microsoft chose to use a different representation 
 *     so casting is necessary when sockets are used with normal Win32  function calls. Unfortunately, this dependency 
 *     on SOCKET translates to a dependency on <winsock2.h> which everyone actively tries to avoid. According to the 
 *     documentation at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/socket-data-type-2 no assumption can be 
 *     made about the range of SOCKET other than that it is a value in the rance [0, INVALID_SOCKET-1]. On the other 
 *     hand, Microsoft guarantees a stable ABI so one could take advantage of that and rely on the underlying type used 
 *     for handles (UINT_PTR) which matches the more standard uintptr_t from <stdint.h>. Furthermore according to this 
 *     article https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sysinfo/kernel-objects windows has a per-process limit on 
 *     kernel handles of 2^24 which makes it relatively safe to cast to intptr_t or even int under the normal assumption 
 *     that sizeof(int) >= sizeof(intptr_t). The fact that INVALID_SOCKET has always been defined as (~0) seems to 
 *     support the notion that casting from SOCKET to int and back should not cause loss of data. All this will make 
 *     purists whimper but looking at the big picture Microsoft could have simply used int from the beginning.

    /* WSAEOPNOTSUPP (10045) "Operation not supported" should never be relayed to the end-user. It can only happen due

    /* WSAEINPROGRESS (10036) "Operation now in progress" is not equivalent to EINPROGRESS. 
     *
     * TL;DR: On Unix EINPROGRESS is only indicated by connect(2) and is semantically equivalent to EWOULDBLOCK (and by 
     * extension to WSAEWOULDBLOCK). On Windows (winsock 2.x) WSAEINPROGRESS should only (if ever) be indicated by 
     * connect() and is semantically equivalent to WSAEALREADY (and by extension to EALREADY).
     *
     *
     * The long story:
     * On BSD sockets EINPROGRESS is indicated when an operation that takes a long time to complete (such as a 
     * connect(2)) was attempted on a non-blocking socket (see ioctl(2)). On windows this is indicated by 
     * WSAEWOULDBLOCK because WSAEINPROGRESS only applies to blocking calls!. When winsock was introduced (v1.x), 
     * Microsoft operating systems (MS-DOS/Win3.x/Win95) did not support preemptive scheduling so blocking operations 
     * that could not complete immediately had to be implemented using a pseudo-blocking mechanism that had to blend 
     * in the application main loop whlie handling windows messages so the UI would not hang. This is more or less 
     * described in this MSN article: 
     * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/windows-sockets-1-1-blocking-routines-and-einprogress-2.
     * In this context winsock only allowed a single blocking operation to be outstanding per task (or thread), and if 
     * the user made any other blocking call (whether or not it referenced the same socket) the function would fail with 
     * WSAEINPROGRESS. Since WinSock 2.x, all Windows versions featured a preemptive 32-bit kernel so this error should
     * not be observable anymore. Nevertheless, anecdotal evidence suggests winsock might still return it after an 
     * application calls connect() a second time on a non-blocking socket while the first connection attempt is pending 
     * (i.e. after the first returned with WSAEWOULDBLOCK) although the documentation states WSAEALREADY should be 
     * expected instead.
     *
     * In any case, since our socket API is exclusively non-blocking, EINPROGRESS and EWOULDBLOCK are redundant and 
     * should never reach the user.

    /* WSAENETRESET (10052) "Network dropped connection on reset" has a special meaning for TCP and UDP sockets.

     * activity that detected a failure while the operation was in progress. This is semantically equivalent to 
     * ENETRESET. For a datagram socket, this error indicates that the time to live has expired which is detectable
     * because routers can send back an ICMP packet indicating that a packet was dropped because TTL reached zero. Note
     * that ICMP packets may be dropped by other routers or blocked by firewalls though. For now this error should
     * be ignored for udp sockets on both setsockopt(), send() and recv().
