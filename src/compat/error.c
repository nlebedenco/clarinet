    /* WSAEINPROGRESS (10036) "Operation now in progress" is not equivalent to EINPROGRESS.
     *
     * TL;DR: On Unix EINPROGRESS is only indicated by connect(2) and is semantically equivalent to EWOULDBLOCK (and by
     * extension to WSAEWOULDBLOCK). On Windows (winsock 2.x) WSAEINPROGRESS should only (if ever) be indicated by
     * connect() and is semantically equivalent to WSAEALREADY (and by extension to EALREADY).
     *
     * Long story:
     *
     * On BSD sockets EINPROGRESS is indicated when an operation that takes a long time to complete (such as a
     * connect(2)) was attempted on a non-blocking socket (see ioctl(2)). On windows this is indicated by
     * WSAEWOULDBLOCK because WSAEINPROGRESS only applies to blocking calls!. When winsock was introduced (v1.x),
     * Microsoft operating systems (MS-DOS/Win3.x/Win95) did not support preemptive scheduling so blocking operations
     * that could not complete immediately had to be implemented using a pseudo-blocking mechanism that had to blend
     * in the application main loop whlie handling windows messages so the UI would not hang. This is more or less
     * described in this MSN article:
     * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/windows-sockets-1-1-blocking-routines-and-einprogress-2.
     *
     * In this context winsock only allowed a single blocking operation to be outstanding per task (or thread), and if
     * the user made any other blocking call (whether or not it referenced the same socket) the function would fail with
     * WSAEINPROGRESS. Since WinSock 2.x, all Windows versions featured a preemptive 32-bit kernel so this error should
     * not be observable anymore. Nevertheless, anecdotal evidence suggests winsock might still return it after an
     * application calls connect() a second time on a non-blocking socket while the first connection attempt is pending
     * (i.e. after the first returned with WSAEWOULDBLOCK) although the documentation states WSAEALREADY should be
     * expected instead.
     *
     * In any case, since our socket API is exclusively non-blocking, EINPROGRESS and EWOULDBLOCK are redundant and
     * should never reach the user.
     */

    /* WSAENETRESET (10052) "Network dropped connection on reset" has a special meaning for TCP and UDP sockets.
     * For a connection-oriented socket, this error indicates that the connection has been broken due to keep-alive
     * activity that detected a failure while the operation was in progress. This is semantically equivalent to
     * ENETRESET. For a datagram socket, this error indicates that the time to live has expired which is detectable
     * because routers can send back an ICMP packet indicating that a packet was dropped because TTL reached zero. Note
     * that ICMP packets may be dropped by other routers or blocked by firewalls though. This error should be ignored
     * for udp sockets in calrinet_socket_setopt(), calrinet_socket_send() and calrinet_socket_recv().
